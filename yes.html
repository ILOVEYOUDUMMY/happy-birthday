  <pre>  Afin Azbi,
    
    
    Happy Valentine's Day! Even though we're miles apart, my heart feels pretty close to you.
    
    Each text, each convertation, adds another sweet layer to our story.
    
    Your voice is my favorite melody, and your love is the perfect kind of magic.
    
    Here's to crushing this distance and turning every day into a little celebration of us.
    
    Sending all my love,
    
    
    XOXO   </pre>
